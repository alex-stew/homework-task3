This application is a password generator, capable of producing a unique password between 8 - 128 characters. It will prompt users of the webpage to answer a series of questions which then influences the output of the password generator function.

It uses prompts to ask the following questions:
        - length of password
        - inclusion of character sets
            a. uppercase
            b. lowercase
            c. symbols
            d. numbers
        
The application then runs and outputs a unique password based on the selection from the prompts. Within the console you can see the 'for' loop as it runs, passing a randomly generated number and assigns to a string variable from the character set list, up to the length selected.

 The output produces a strong and unique password for most - if not all - day to day uses. Upon further research of secure password protection measures, for classified or sensitive file information, more stringent password generators shhould be implemented. 

 I hope that you like the generator.
